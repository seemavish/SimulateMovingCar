# Car Simulation

This is a simple C++ program to simulate the behaviour of a moving car. 
It includes classes and functions to manage the speed, gear, and functionalities of a moving car, like accelerate, gear shifting, and braking.

# Let's drive

- Start the engine using 'startEngine()' (gear set to 1)
- Accelerate and keep accelerating using 'pedal()'. Change the gear when needed using 'shift(toNewGear)'
- When the speed limit of the gear is reached, either change the gear to accelerate or press the brake to slow down using 'brake()' (speed reduces by 10 mph for every press)
- Retrieve car speed and gear information at every point
